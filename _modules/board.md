<summary markdown="span">The Knob on the Y-Board
</summary>

The knob is a device known as a **potentiometer**. We send a _voltage_ through it and measure how much of that voltage is allowed to pass through, based on the position of the knob. This allows us to return a value based on the current position of the knob using the `Yboard.get_knob()` function.

## Functions

We can use the value returned from the `Yboard.get_knob()` function to change the brightness of the LEDs on our board. This is the code:

```cpp
while(true) {
    int brightness = 255 * Yboard.get_knob() / 100;
    Yboard.set_led_brightness(brightness);

    // Then use Yboard.set_led_color() as normal inside this loop.
}
```

You'll notice that we've multiplied the value of `Yboard.get_knob()` by 255 and divided it by 100. The reason is because `Yboard.set_led_brightness()` needs a brightness between 0 and 255, but `Yboard.get_knob()` gives us a value between 0 and 100. We can _scale_ our value from `Yboard.get_knob()` to a value that `Yboard.set_led_brightness()` will understand by _multiplying_ it by the maximum value of our _brightness function_ and _dividing_ by the maximum value of our _knob function_.

Notice also that we are monitoring the value of `Yboard.get_knob()` continuously by placing it inside an infinite `while` loop.

There are other things you can try to control with `Yboard.get_knob()` (for example, you could use it to change the _color_ of LEDs rather than brightness) but brightness is the easiest. Feel free to experiment with it!

## Design Your Own Y-Board

Now it's your turn to customize your board. Write code to make it your own. You could make it into a three-key piano, display a spectacular light show, or anything else. The possibilities are endless! Just be sure to put all the skills you've learned to good use!

```c
// conditionals_activity();
